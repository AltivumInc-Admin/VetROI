# VetROIâ„¢ Development Documentation

## Project Vision & Strategy

**VetROIâ„¢** (Veteran Return on Investment) is the flagship SaaS product of Altivum Inc., designed to revolutionize how military veterans transition to civilian careers. This is not a hackathon projectâ€”it's a production application strategically launching through the AWS Lambda Hackathon 2025 for market validation and visibility.

### Business Strategy
- **Market Validation**: AWS hackathon placement serves as proof of concept and market demand
- **Strategic Launch**: Using competition for credibility, visibility, and potential funding
- **Real Impact**: Addressing the critical need of 200,000+ veterans transitioning annually
- **Revenue Model**: Freemium SaaS with premium features for career coaching and enterprise partnerships

## Current Architecture Status (June 16, 2025)

### âœ… Phase 1: Data Collection & Career Discovery (COMPLETED)

#### Production Frontend
- **Production URL**: https://vetroi.altivum.ai (custom domain via CloudFront)
- **Amplify App ID**: d34razwlkdgpdv (us-east-2)
- **Technology**: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite
- **Hosting**: AWS Amplify with CI/CD from GitHub
- **UI Theme**: Dark glassmorphic design with cyan accents (#00d4ff)

#### User Flow (Working Perfectly - DO NOT CHANGE)
1. **Veteran Profile Input**
   - Branch, MOS/Rate/AFSC, Education, Home State, Relocation preference
   
2. **MOS Confirmation Step**
   - O*NET API translates military code to job title
   - Shows: "Special Forces Medical Sergeant (18D)"
   - User confirms or adjusts

3. **Career Match Display**
   - Shows 25 O*NET career matches
   - Bright Outlook badges for high-growth careers
   - Rolodex-style navigation on mobile
   - User selects careers of interest

4. **Detailed Analysis View**
   - Fetches full O*NET career reports
   - Beautiful cards showing:
     - Career title and SOC code
     - What They Do description
     - Salary data (10th, median, 90th percentile)
     - Education requirements
     - Location quotient for user's state
     - Skills, abilities, knowledge required
     - Job outlook and growth projections

#### Production Backend
- **API Gateway**: https://jg5fae61lj.execute-api.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/prod
- **Lambda Function**: `VetROI_Recommend` 
  - Handler: `lambda_function.lambda_handler`
  - Runtime: Python 3.12
  - Uses urllib3 (no external dependencies needed)

#### API Endpoints (Both Working Perfectly)
1. **POST /recommend**
   - Input: `{branch, code, homeState, relocate, education}`
   - Calls: O*NET `/online/crosswalks/military?keyword={code}`
   - Returns: 25 career matches with occupation details
   - Response structure:
   ```json
   {
     "session_id": "uuid",
     "profile": {...},
     "onet_careers": {
       "match": [{
         "code": "18D",
         "title": "Special Forces Medical Sergeant (Army - Enlisted)",
         "occupations": {
           "occupation": [/* 25 careers */]
         }
       }]
     }
   }
   ```

2. **GET /career/{socCode}**
   - Input: SOC code (e.g., "29-1141.00")
   - Calls: O*NET `/mnm/careers/{soc}/report`
   - Returns: Complete career report with all details
   - Frontend parses this beautifully - no changes needed

#### O*NET Integration
- **Credentials**: Stored in AWS Secrets Manager (secret: "ONET")
- **Authentication**: Basic auth with credentials from Secrets Manager
- **Headers**: Accept: application/json
- **NO AI/Bedrock** in data collection phase - pure O*NET data

#### Infrastructure Components
```
AWS Services Deployed:
â”œâ”€â”€ Lambda: VetROI_Recommend (handles both endpoints)
â”œâ”€â”€ API Gateway: jg5fae61lj (HTTP API with CORS)
â”œâ”€â”€ DynamoDB: VetROI_Sessions (stores session data)
â”œâ”€â”€ Secrets Manager: ONET credentials
â”œâ”€â”€ S3 Buckets: 
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ vetroi-lambda-artifacts-* (Lambda deployments)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ altroi-data (O*NET career data lake - 1,139 careers)
â”œâ”€â”€ Amplify: d34razwlkdgpdv (frontend hosting)
â”œâ”€â”€ CloudFront: vetroi.altivum.ai distribution
â””â”€â”€ Step Functions: VetROI_DATA (data pipeline)
```

### ðŸŽ¯ What's Working Perfectly (DO NOT CHANGE)

- âœ… MOS to job title translation
- âœ… 25 career matches from O*NET crosswalk
- âœ… Career selection interface
- âœ… Detailed career analysis with full O*NET data

   - Uses Amazon Bedrock (Nova Lite)
   - Contextual understanding of military background
   - Personalized career guidance
   - Next steps and action items

3. **Integration Points**
   - New endpoint: POST /sentra/conversation
   - Bedrock integration (already have permissions)
   - Session continuity from DynamoDB
