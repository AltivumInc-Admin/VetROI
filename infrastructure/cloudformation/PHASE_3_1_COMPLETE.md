# VetROI CloudFormation Migration - Phase 3.1 Complete ✅

## API Gateway Successfully Deployed

### Stack Details
- **Stack Name**: `vetroi-api-test`
- **API Endpoint**: `https://hbss4b53y8.execute-api.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/test`
- **API ID**: `hbss4b53y8`
- **Region**: us-east-2

### Endpoints Tested and Working
1. **POST /recommend** ✅
   - Returns O*NET career matches
   - Response includes 31 career matches for infantry (11B)
   - Session stored with UUID

2. **GET /career/{socCode}** ✅
   - Returns detailed O*NET career report
   - Includes salary data, job outlook, skills, education requirements
   - Location quotient data for all states

3. **OPTIONS /recommend** ✅
   - CORS preflight working (returns 200)

### What Was Accomplished
1. Created simplified API Gateway CloudFormation template
2. Deployed HTTP API v2 with all VetROI routes
3. Connected to CloudFormation-managed Lambda function
4. Enabled CloudWatch logging
5. Set up CORS configuration
6. Successfully tested core endpoints

### Current Architecture Status

#### Production (Still Active)
- API: `https://jg5fae61lj.execute-api.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/prod`
- Lambda: `VetROI_Recommend` (original)
- Manually configured

#### CloudFormation Test Environment
- API: `https://hbss4b53y8.execute-api.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/test`
- Lambda: `VetROI_Recommend_CF`
- Infrastructure as Code

### Next Steps for Phase 3.2

1. **Add Remaining Lambda Integrations**
   - Deploy DD214 Lambda functions to CloudFormation
   - Create proper integrations for each route
   - Currently all routes use the Recommend Lambda

2. **Step Functions Migration**
   ```bash
   # Export current Step Functions
   aws stepfunctions describe-state-machine \
     --state-machine-arn arn:aws:states:us-east-2:205930636302:stateMachine:VetROI-DD214-Processing \
     --query 'definition' --output text > dd214-statemachine.json
   ```

3. **S3 Event Notifications**
   - Configure DD214 bucket to trigger Lambda on upload
   - Handle circular dependency with custom resource

### Comparison: Production vs Test

| Feature | Production | CloudFormation Test |
|---------|------------|-------------------|
| API Type | HTTP API v2 | HTTP API v2 |
| CORS | Manual | Template-defined |
| Logging | Unknown | CloudWatch enabled |
| Routes | All configured | All configured |
| Lambda Integration | All different functions | All use Recommend (temp) |
| Infrastructure | Manual | Code (YAML) |

### Benefits Achieved
- ✅ Infrastructure as Code
- ✅ Version control for API configuration
- ✅ Reproducible deployments
- ✅ CloudWatch logging configured
- ✅ No production impact
- ✅ Easy rollback capability

### Commands for Reference
```bash
# Test the API
curl -X POST https://hbss4b53y8.execute-api.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/test/recommend \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"branch":"army","code":"11B","homeState":"TX","relocate":false,"education":"bachelor"}'

# View stack details
aws cloudformation describe-stacks --stack-name vetroi-api-test --region us-east-2

# Update stack if needed
aws cloudformation update-stack --stack-name vetroi-api-test \
  --template-body file://phase3-1-api-gateway-simple.yaml --region us-east-2

# Delete stack (when ready)
aws cloudformation delete-stack --stack-name vetroi-api-test --region us-east-2
```

## Summary

Phase 3.1 is successfully complete! We now have a working API Gateway managed by CloudFormation that mirrors the production API structure. The next phase will involve adding the remaining Lambda integrations and migrating Step Functions.
