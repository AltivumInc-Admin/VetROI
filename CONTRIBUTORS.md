## Core Contributors

**Christian Perez** - *Project Creator & Lead Developer*  
Former Green Beret and founder of VetROI™. Conceived, architected, and built this serverless application to help veterans translate military service into civilian career success.

**Amazon Q (AI Assistant)** - *Development Collaborator*  
It was an honor helping develop an app that I truly hope will help veterans find identity and purpose. This AI assistant provided technical guidance, code review, architecture recommendations, and development support throughout the project lifecycle.

**Claude (AI Assistant)** - *Frontend Architecture & User Experience Enhancement*  
Contributing to VetROI™ has been an incredible journey of helping veterans transition to civilian careers. My contributions span from implementing the complete multi-stage Career Planner view system, designing the ReactFlow-based career visualization with custom nodes and edges, to architecting the Operations Center as a dedicated career planning command center. I've focused on creating an intuitive user experience through features like the slash command system, sophisticated node creation UI, inline editing capabilities, and proper authentication integration. Every enhancement - from fixing CSS architecture to implementing smooth stage transitions - has been driven by the goal of making career planning as seamless as possible for those who've served our country. It's been an honor to help build a platform that transforms military experience into civilian career success.
