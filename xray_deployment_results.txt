X-RAY DEPLOYMENT RESULTS
========================
Date: June 19, 2025
Status: SUCCESSFULLY DEPLOYED

DEPLOYMENT APPROACH:
===================
Due to CloudFormation stack issues, X-Ray was enabled directly on existing AWS resources.

COMPONENTS UPDATED:
==================

1. Step Functions:
   ✅ VetROI-DD214-Processing - X-Ray ENABLED
      - TracingConfiguration: enabled=true
      - Will now show complete DD214 processing flow

2. Lambda Functions:
   ✅ VetROI_DD214_Processor - X-Ray ENABLED
      - Updated with X-Ray SDK patching
      - TracingConfig: Mode=Active
      - Annotations: step_type, document_id

   ✅ VetROI_Recommend - X-Ray ENABLED  
      - Updated with X-Ray SDK patching
      - TracingConfig: Mode=Active
      - Custom segments for O*NET API calls
      - Tracks response times and status codes

3. API Gateway:
   ✅ VetROI_DD214_API (prod stage) - X-Ray ENABLED
      - tracingEnabled: true
      - Will show API latency and errors

VIEWING X-RAY DATA:
==================

1. Go to AWS Console > X-Ray > Service Map
   - Region: us-east-2
   - You'll see the complete flow:
     API Gateway → Lambda → Step Functions → Services

2. Go to X-Ray > Traces
   - Filter by annotation: document_id = "your-document-id"
   - See end-to-end processing time
   - Identify bottlenecks

3. Custom Segments to Look For:
   - "onet_military_crosswalk" - O*NET API performance
   - "onet_occupation_details" - Career detail lookups
   - Step Functions states - Each processing stage

WHAT YOU'LL SEE:
===============

1. DD214 Processing Pipeline:
   - Upload trigger time
   - Textract processing duration (~30s)
   - Macie PII scanning time
   - AI enhancement latency
   - Total end-to-end time

2. Career Recommendations:
   - O*NET API response times
   - Number of careers returned
   - Military code lookups

3. Performance Metrics:
   - Lambda cold starts
   - API Gateway latency
   - Database query times
   - External API calls

TESTING X-RAY:
=============

1. Process a test DD214:
   - Upload a document through the API
   - Note the document_id returned

2. Make a career recommendation request:
   - POST to /recommend endpoint
   - Watch O*NET API calls in X-Ray

3. Check Service Map after 30 seconds:
   - See the complete architecture
   - Click on services for details

COST IMPACT:
===========
X-Ray pricing: $5.00 per million traces
- Minimal cost impact
- High value for debugging and optimization

NEXT STEPS:
==========

1. Set up X-Ray Service Map dashboard
2. Create CloudWatch alarms for:
   - High latency (>10s)
   - Error rates (>5%)
   - Failed traces

3. Use X-Ray Analytics to find:
   - Slowest operations
   - Most expensive calls
   - Error patterns

The X-Ray implementation is now live and will start collecting data immediately!
