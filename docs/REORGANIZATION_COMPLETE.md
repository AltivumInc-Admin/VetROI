# Repository Reorganization Complete

## Date: June 20, 2025

### Summary of Changes

The VetROI repository has been thoroughly reorganized for the AWS Lambda Hackathon 2025 submission. The following changes were made to create a clean, professional structure:

## Root Directory Cleanup

### Files Kept in Root (4 files only)
1. **README.md** - Main project documentation and entry point
2. **LICENSE** - MIT License demonstrating open-source understanding
3. **DEVELOPMENT.md** - Comprehensive development guide (renamed from CLAUDE.md)
4. **REPOSITORY_GUIDE.md** - Complete repository navigation map with ASCII diagram

### Documentation Organization

All documentation has been organized into logical subdirectories under `/docs`:

```
docs/
├── README.md                    # Documentation index
├── REORGANIZATION_LOG.md        # Initial reorganization record
├── REORGANIZATION_COMPLETE.md   # This file
├── ai-ml/                       # AI/ML enhancements (4 files)
├── architecture/                # System design docs (3 files)
├── cleanup/                     # Maintenance guides (2 files)
├── cost-tracking/               # Cost analysis (1 file)
├── deployment-guides/           # Deployment procedures (3 files)
├── implementation/              # Development roadmaps (2 files)
├── product-vision/              # Product strategy (4 files)
├── troubleshooting/             # Problem-solving guides (3 files)
└── images/                      # Architecture diagrams (2 files)
```

### Additional Cleanup

1. **Moved AWS MCP Servers** → `/mcp-servers/`
2. **Moved diagram generators** → `/scripts/diagram-generators/`
3. **Removed duplicate directory** → `lambda-functions/` (configs moved to `/infrastructure/lambda-configs/`)
4. **Created .gitattributes** → Proper file handling and language statistics

### Repository Structure Benefits

- **Clean Root**: Only essential files visible at first glance
- **Logical Organization**: Easy navigation for hackathon judges
- **Professional Appearance**: Shows attention to detail
- **Preserved History**: All documentation maintained, just organized
- **Clear Navigation**: REPOSITORY_GUIDE.md provides complete map

### Impact on Development

- No code changes required
- All paths in documentation updated
- Git history preserved
- CI/CD unaffected
- Application continues to work perfectly

This reorganization demonstrates professional software engineering practices while maintaining all the valuable documentation that shows the project's evolution and depth.
