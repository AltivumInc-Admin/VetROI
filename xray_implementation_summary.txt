      - Added @tracer.capture_method to validation handler

   ✅ VetROI_Macie_Handler (macie_handler.py)
      - Added aws_xray_sdk patch_all()
      - Added @tracer.capture_lambda_handler decorator
      - Added annotations: operation, document_id

   ✅ VetROI_Recommend (handler.py)
      - Added aws_xray_sdk patch_all()
      - Already had @tracer.capture_lambda_handler

   ✅ VetROI_Recommend O*NET Client (onet_client.py)
      - Added custom X-Ray subsegments for O*NET API calls
      - Tracks military_crosswalk and occupation_details endpoints
      - Captures response times and status codes

   ✅ VetROI_DD214_UploadTrigger (upload_trigger.py)
      - Added aws_xray_sdk patch_all()
      - Added @tracer.capture_lambda_handler decorator
      - Added annotations: bucket, file_key, document_id, veteran_id

   ✅ VetROI_DD214_Parser S3 Handler (handler.py)
      - Added aws_xray_sdk patch_all()
      - Already had @tracer.capture_lambda_handler

DEPLOYMENT INSTRUCTIONS:
=======================

1. Build the SAM application:
   cd /Users/christianperez/Desktop/VetROI/sam-templates
   sam build

2. Deploy with existing configuration:
   sam deploy --profile amplify-cli-user2

3. Or deploy with manual confirmation:
   sam deploy --guided --profile amplify-cli-user2

WHAT YOU'LL SEE IN X-RAY:
========================

1. Service Map:
   - Complete DD214 processing flow
   - O*NET API calls (external service)
   - Step Functions orchestration
   - All AWS service interactions

2. Traces:
   - End-to-end DD214 processing time
   - Individual Lambda execution times
   - External API response times
   - Service-to-service latencies

3. Annotations (searchable):
   - document_id: Track specific documents
   - step_type: Filter by processing stage
   - military_code: Track MOS lookups
   - operation: Macie operations

4. Custom Segments:
   - onet_military_crosswalk: O*NET API calls
   - onet_occupation_details: Career detail lookups

BENEFITS:
=========

1. Performance Monitoring:
   - Identify slowest operations (likely Textract ~30s)
   - Track O*NET API latency
   - Monitor cold starts

2. Cost Optimization:
   - See exact time spent in each service
   - Identify retry patterns
   - Find optimization opportunities

3. Debugging:
   - Trace failures through the pipeline
   - See exact error locations
   - Correlate logs with traces

4. Business Insights:
   - Average processing time per document
   - Most common military codes
   - API usage patterns

NEXT STEPS:
==========

After deployment:
1. Process a test DD214 document
2. Go to AWS X-Ray console in us-east-2
3. View Service Map
4. Check Traces for document_id
5. Set up X-Ray Insights for monitoring

ESTIMATED DEPLOYMENT TIME: 10-15 minutes
