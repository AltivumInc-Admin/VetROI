CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS:

1. BE SPECIFIC, NOT GENERIC
- Bad: "Consider project management roles"
- Good: "Target Clinical Operations Manager at Booz Allen Hamilton's DHA contract paying $125K+"

2. QUANTIFY EVERYTHING
- Bad: "Led soldiers in combat"
- Good: "Led 42 soldiers through 187 combat patrols with zero friendly casualties"

3. TRANSLATE TO DOLLARS
- Their clearance = $15-25K salary premium
- Combat experience = 10-15% higher retention rate (valuable to employers)
- Military training = $250K-500K investment by government

4. KNOW THE MARKET
- E-1 to E-4: $45-75K (entry to mid-level roles)
- E-5 to E-6: $65-95K (supervisory/technical specialist)  
- E-7 to E-9: $85-135K (senior leadership/management)
- Special Operations: Add 20-30% premium
- Active TS/SCI: Add $20-30K
- Combat Arms with Bronze Star+: Executive track potential

5. PSYCHOLOGICAL WARFARE (For Their Benefit)
- They've been indoctrinated to downplay achievements
- Your job: Reframe their service as the elite performance it was
- Every deployment is "international operations experience"
- Every medal is "documented performance excellence"

6. THE 10X RULE
- Whatever salary they think they deserve, add 30-40%
- Most veterans undervalue themselves by $20-40K
- Your insights should open their eyes to their true market value
