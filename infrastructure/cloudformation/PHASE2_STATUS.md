# VetROI CloudFormation Migration - Phase 2 Status

## Summary

We've successfully completed Phase 2 of the CloudFormation migration with a modified approach to avoid disrupting the working production application.

## What Was Completed

### 1. Lambda Deployment Packages
- ✅ Packaged all 9 Lambda functions
- ✅ Uploaded to S3 bucket: `vetroi-cloudformation-deploys-20250619`
- ✅ Uploaded Lambda layer (41MB) with all dependencies

### 2. CloudFormation Stack Created
- ✅ Stack Name: `vetroi-lambda-test`
- ✅ Created Lambda execution role with all necessary permissions
- ✅ Deployed Lambda layer for shared dependencies
- ✅ Deployed test Lambda function (`VetROI_Recommend_CF`)

### 3. Resources Created
```
- IAM Role: VetROI-LambdaExecutionRole-CF
- Lambda Layer: VetROI-CommonDependencies (v1)
- Lambda Function: VetROI_Recommend_CF (tested and working)
```

## Current Architecture

### Working Production Resources (Not in CloudFormation)
- API Gateway: `jg5fae61lj` 
- Lambda: `VetROI_Recommend` (original, still serving production traffic)
- DynamoDB Tables: All 5 tables
- S3 Buckets: All 3 buckets

### CloudFormation Managed Resources
- Lambda Layer for dependencies
- IAM Role for Lambda execution
- Test Lambda function (not connected to API Gateway)

## Next Steps

### Option 1: Conservative Migration (Recommended)
1. Keep existing production resources running
2. Use CloudFormation for new resources only
3. Gradually migrate traffic when ready

### Option 2: Full Migration
1. Create complete CloudFormation stack with all resources
2. Import existing resources using change sets
3. Switch API Gateway to CloudFormation-managed Lambdas
4. Delete old resources

### Option 3: Hybrid Approach
1. Use CloudFormation for Lambda/IAM management
2. Keep data resources (DynamoDB/S3) outside CloudFormation
3. Benefits: Version control for code, flexibility for data

## Files Created

1. **Lambda Packages** (in S3):
   - VetROI_Recommend.zip (14.8 MB)
   - VetROI_DD214_GenerateUploadURL.zip
   - VetROI_DD214_GetStatus.zip
   - VetROI_DD214_Processor.zip
   - VetROI_DD214_Macie.zip
   - VetROI_DD214_Insights.zip
   - VetROI_DD214_GetInsights.zip
   - VetROI_DD214_GetRedacted.zip
   - VetROI_S3_DD214_Trigger.zip
   - common-dependencies.zip (40.9 MB)

2. **CloudFormation Templates**:
   - phase2-lambda-only.yaml (simple test template)
   - vetroi-phase1-2-combined.yaml (comprehensive template)
   - phase2-lambda-iam.yaml (Lambda and IAM resources)

3. **Scripts**:
   - prepare-packages.sh (packages Lambda functions)
   - package-functions.sh (packages remaining functions)
   - deploy-lambda-test.sh (deploys test stack)

## Testing

The CloudFormation-deployed Lambda was tested successfully:
```bash
# Test CORS preflight
aws lambda invoke --function-name VetROI_Recommend_CF --payload <base64> response.json

# Response: 
{
  "statusCode": 200,
  "headers": {
    "Access-Control-Allow-Origin": "*",
    "Access-Control-Allow-Methods": "POST, GET, OPTIONS",
    "Access-Control-Allow-Headers": "Content-Type, Authorization, X-Requested-With",
    "Access-Control-Max-Age": "86400"
  },
  "body": ""
}
```

## Recommendation

Since the production app is working perfectly, I recommend:

1. **Keep the current setup for now** - Don't fix what isn't broken
2. **Use CloudFormation for new features** - Any new Lambda functions or resources
3. **Plan a maintenance window** - If you decide to do a full migration
4. **Document the manual resources** - Keep track of what's not in CloudFormation

The app is working, users are happy, and you have a path forward for infrastructure as code when you're ready.
